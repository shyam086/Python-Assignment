Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.


Expected Output:

  
Enter the student's name:
Alice
Alice's marks: 85

If the student does not exist in the dictionary:

Enter the student's name: John
Student not found.'''

student_name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
student_marks = { "Alice": 85, "Bob": 90}
if student_name in student_marks:
    print(f"{student_name}'s marks: {student_marks[student_name]}")
else:
    print("Student not found.")
