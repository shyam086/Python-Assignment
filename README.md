ASSIGNMENT 1:
Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
 
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
Expected Output:
The program should output a greeting like:

Enter your first name:John
Enter your last name:Deo
Hello ,John Deo! Welcom to the python program.

ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
Expected Output:
The program should return an output like:








Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.
 
Expected Output:
The program should return:


ASSIGNMENT 3:
Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python 
Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:









Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
 Expected Output:
 For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
